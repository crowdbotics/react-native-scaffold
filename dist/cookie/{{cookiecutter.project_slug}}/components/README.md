# @components

## Using components

Any module installed here doesn't get automatically loaded (see Autoloading) and can be used by directly importing it.

Import a component by importing from the `@components` alias:
```javascript
import { yourComponent } from "@components/<your-component>";
```

See your [metro.config.js](/metro.config.js) for more details about other alias included by default.
